Born in 1995, currently studying Languages and Cultures for International Commerce in Verona, I'm a Tor relay operator also interested in infosec, transparency, hacking and free software. Sometimes I translate things.

More informations on my Tor relay [here](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/contact:pigaianiedoardo(at)gmail(dot)com).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edoardopigaiani), [Github](https://github.com/edoardopigaiani) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/edoardopigaiani).
